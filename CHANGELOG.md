# Changelog

All notable changes to Atomic are documented here.

## v1.21.0 — 2026-04-11

- Add Dashboard view with AI daily briefing — a new home screen featuring a scheduled, LLM-generated summary of recently captured atoms with clickable inline citations and an embedded canvas preview
- Add briefing history navigation with prev/next controls to browse past daily briefings
- Consolidate Grid and List into a single Atoms view with a compact layout sub-toggle, simplifying the top-level navigation to four modes: Dashboard, Atoms, Canvas, and Wiki
- Migrate ~170 inline SVG icons to Lucide React, reducing frontend bundle size by ~4 kB gzipped
- Improve reliability of structured LLM outputs (wiki synthesis, tag extraction, briefing) with unified retry logic, tolerant JSON parsing, and a prompt-based fallback for providers that ignore response_format

## v1.20.2 — 2026-04-11

- Cache the global canvas payload in memory with automatic invalidation on atom, tag, and edge changes — eliminates redundant PCA recomputation and makes the canvas load significantly faster after the first request
- Warm the canvas cache at server startup so the first canvas open is instant instead of waiting for a full recompute
- Optimize canvas metadata query from two correlated subqueries per atom to a single JOIN + GROUP BY, improving canvas load time for large knowledge bases
- Serialize concurrent cold-cache canvas rebuilds so multiple simultaneous requests share a single computation instead of racing

## v1.20.1 — 2026-04-11

- Fix release notification formatting in the CI pipeline (no user-facing changes).

## v1.20.0 — 2026-04-11

- Add configurable auto-tag categories — choose which top-level tags the AI auto-tagger is allowed to extend (e.g. disable People/Locations if you don't need them, or add your own like "Projects" or "Books"), manageable during onboarding and in Settings → Tags
- Add Obsidian plugin onboarding wizard with a 4-step setup flow, database selection, size-based sync batching, YAML frontmatter stripping, and real-time sync progress reporting
- Fix mobile layout — sidebar, chat, and filter controls now work correctly on small screens with a slide-in sidebar, full-width chat overlay, filter bottom-sheet, and an overflow menu for reader actions
- Fix Obsidian plugin resync loop when the target database already contains atoms — re-syncing to a populated database now deduplicates server-side instead of retrying endlessly
- Skip the onboarding wizard when connecting to a server that is already configured with an AI provider
- Fix Obsidian plugin wiki view to preserve citation markers for notes outside the current vault instead of stripping them
